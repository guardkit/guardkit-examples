# ADR-001: Adopt GuardKit System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a lightweight task workflow system with built-in quality gates that prevents broken code from reaching production.

## Decision
Adopt the GuardKit system with automated architectural review and test enforcement.

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Quality-first approach with automated gates
- Lightweight task workflow (create → work → complete)
- AI collaboration with human oversight
- Zero ceremony overhead

**Negative:**
- Initial setup required
- Learning curve for quality gates
